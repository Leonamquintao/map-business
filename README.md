# Map Business

Project destined at studying ReactJs with addition to Typescript.

## Settings

The project uses `Parcel` as a tool to help us run `Typescript` in the browser.

`npm install -g parcel-bundler`

`npm install @faker-js/faker`

You'll then need to update your imports:

`import faker from '@faker-js/faker';`

> parcel index.html
